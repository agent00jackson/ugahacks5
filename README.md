## Inspiration
The desire to connect learning about investment and excitement in finance with a younger audience.

## What it does
Our app makes investing easier by showing you companies along with a short description, stock information, and a portfolio. By swiping right, this company will be added to a saved list for potential investments.

## How we built it
We used Android Studio in Java to write the application and Python for the back-end to handle rest API's.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us have had any Android Studio experience. Many of us didn't have much web API experience either. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning how to make an Android app. Getting experience with restful web API's, especially consuming them. 

## What we learned
How to write web API's in Python and creating applications in Android Studio.

## What's next for WolfX
Integration with a system enabling us to add the ability for users to invest in companies directly.
